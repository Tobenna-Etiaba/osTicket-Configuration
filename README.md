# <h2>THE AGENT & ADMIN PANELS</h2>
 - Within the the backend of osTicket there is the Agent Panel and The Admin Panel.
   - The Admin panel is where everything gets set up from the creation and configuration of users, teams, departments etc.
   - The Agent panel is where tickets are viewed and attended to.

- Whenever a member of an organisation has a problem that needs to be sorted (e.g: password reset) they can put it through on their end and it will then appear in the agent panel
